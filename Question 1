q)What is an Exception in Java?

In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It represents an error or an unexpected condition that arises while the program is running. When an exceptional situation occurs, the Java runtime creates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as its type and a message describing the problem.
