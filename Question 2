What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling is a mechanism in Java that allows developers to deal with runtime exceptions in a structured and controlled manner. It enables the program to recover from unexpected errors or exceptional situations without terminating abnormally. By using exception handling, developers can identify, catch, and handle exceptions, providing alternate pathways for the program to continue its execution even in the presence of errors.
