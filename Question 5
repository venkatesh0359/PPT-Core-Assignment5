What is multithreading in Java, and what are its advantages?

(memory space) but run in a separate execution context. The advantages of multithreading in Java include:

Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows concurrent execution, which means that even if one thread is busy, other threads can continue to execute, leading to improved responsiveness and better user experience.

Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads can efficiently utilize the available CPU cores and resources, making the program run faster and utilize system resources effectively.

Simplified Code: In certain scenarios, using multiple threads can simplify the code, especially in tasks involving parallelism and asynchronous processing.

Better Performance for Certain Tasks: Multithreading can significantly enhance the performance of tasks that can be divided into smaller independent subtasks that can execute simultaneously.

Real-time Behavior: For real-time applications, multithreading is essential to meet strict timing requirements and ensure continuous processing.
