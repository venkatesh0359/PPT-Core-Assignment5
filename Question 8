What is Thread in Java?

In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a Java program. It represents an independent path of execution that can perform tasks concurrently with other threads. A Java program can have multiple threads running simultaneously, each executing a specific part of the program's code. Threads share the same memory space, allowing them to access and modify shared data.
